This text is a guide for writing a 250-word essay on household types and changes over time, structured with an introduction, main body, and conclusion. It describes a graphic showing household trends in Germany from 1970 to 2030. Key findings include a doubling of households, more single-person and two-person households, and fewer households with three or more people. Reasons for these changes include increased mobility for work, changes in relationship norms, demographic shifts, and young people's desire for independence. As a result, there are environmental impacts due to increased resource use and challenges in the housing market requiring more small apartments. The conclusion notes that living situations will continue to change with society.
