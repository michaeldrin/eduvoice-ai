You're given a task to write a text using the information from a given graphic and instructions. Your text should be between 160 and 350 words; otherwise, you'll lose points. Write clearly without using pencil or red ink. Your notes won't be graded, and you must include your name and examination number for your work to be evaluated. You have 70 minutes to complete this task. 

Describe the material you have, noticing any standout features. Summarize your observations. Mention your preferred field of study and the group it belongs to, giving two reasons for your choice. Explain why the number of students varies across different groups with two reasons. If your study subject isnâ€™t listed, make educated guesses. Compare how this graphic might look in your country by highlighting two similarities or differences, providing reasons for your claims. Don't forget to include an introduction and a conclusion in your text. The graphic source is from Statista, which shows the number of students in different fields.
