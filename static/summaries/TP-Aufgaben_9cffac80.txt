The text outlines instructions for a writing task as part of the DSH (Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang) exam. Candidates are required to produce a coherent text of approximately 250 words, with a minimum of 160 and a maximum of 350 words, based on a given task and accompanying graphic. The text must be written clearly, avoiding pencil or red ink, and notes will not be assessed. Students must include their name and examination number, as missing these will result in the section not being graded. The time allotted for this task is 70 minutes.

The task involves describing the provided material and identifying notable aspects. Students should summarize the content as much as possible and discuss their desired field of study, including the academic group it belongs to. They must justify their choice with two statements. Additionally, students should explore reasons for the varying numbers of students in different academic groups, providing two reasons with explanations. If their field of study is not represented, they should speculate on its inclusion. The task also requires a comparison between the graphic and the student's home country, identifying two similarities or differences and justifying these observations. An introduction and conclusion are essential components of the text. The source of the graphic is a statistical website, Statista.
