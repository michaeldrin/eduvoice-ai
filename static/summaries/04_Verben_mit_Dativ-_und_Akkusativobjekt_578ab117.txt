The text is a list of German verbs that require either a dative or accusative object (or both) in sentences. Each verb is presented with its required grammar case, followed by an example sentence. For instance, "abnehmen" requires both dative and accusative objects, as shown in the example "Ich nehme dir die Tasche ab." Some verbs use only one object, either dative (e.g., "antworten" with "Bitte antworte mir schnell!") or accusative (e.g., "fragen" with "Kannst du ihn fragen?"). The document provides a wide range of verbs with their uses in sentences to clarify their grammatical requirements.
